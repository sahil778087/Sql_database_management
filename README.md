# Walmart Sales Data Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing Walmart's sales data to uncover meaningful insights using SQL. The analysis involves creating a relational database, performing feature engineering, and writing advanced SQL queries to derive insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and profitability.  

## Objectives  
- To create and manage a structured database for sales data.  
- To analyze customer demographics, sales trends, and financial metrics.  
- To showcase SQL skills, including feature engineering and data querying.  

## Database Details  
The project includes the creation of a table named `sales` with the following fields:  
- **Invoice ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction.  
- **Branch**: Store branch (e.g., A, B, C).  
- **City**: Location of the branch.  
- **Customer Type**: Loyalty (e.g., Member, Normal).  
- **Gender**: Customer's gender.  
- **Product Line**: Category of purchased products.  
- **Unit Price**: Price per unit of the product.  
- **Quantity**: Number of items purchased.  
- **VAT**: Value-added tax applied to the purchase.  
- **Total**: Total transaction amount (including VAT).  
- **Date**: Transaction date.  
- **Time**: Transaction time.  
- **Payment Method**: Mode of payment (e.g., Cash, Credit Card).  
- **COGS**: Cost of goods sold.  
- **Gross Margin Percentage**: Profit margin on the sale.  
- **Gross Income**: Profit from the sale.  
- **Rating**: Customer satisfaction rating for the transaction.  

## Key Features  
- **Feature Engineering**: Categorized sales by time of day into Morning, Afternoon, and Evening.  
- **Insights Derived**:  
  - Popular product categories and their performance.  
  - Trends in sales volume across branches and customer types.  
  - Analysis of gross margins and customer ratings.  

## Technologies Used
